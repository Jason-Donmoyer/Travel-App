# Travel Destination App

## Final project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree

### The purpose of this project is to use multiple API calls to have the user select a destination they wish to travel and the date they will be leaving. The application responds with the weather and an image of the destination.

### To start the app:

1. Open two terminal windows and navigate to the apps directory.
2. In the first window use the command `npm run build-dev`
3. In the second window use the command `npm run build-prod`
4. After this runs, command `npm start`
